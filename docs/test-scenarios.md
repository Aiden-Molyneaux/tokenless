# Manual Test Scenarios

Scenarios a human should exercise before any release. Each scenario lists preconditions, steps, and expected outcomes. Every feature PR adds or updates at least one scenario.

Format:

```
## Scenario: <name>

**Preconditions:** <state of the system before>

**Steps:**
1. ...
2. ...

**Expected:** <observable outcome>
```

---

## Scenario: Phase 0 — Fresh launch

**Preconditions:** Fresh `npm install` complete; no `out/` directory yet.

**Steps:**
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Run `npm run preview` (or `npm run dev`)
3. Observe the window that opens

**Expected:**
- Window title is "TokenLess"
- Window displays "TokenLess — Phase 0 stub" header
- A version line shows `preload.version = 0.0.1`

## Scenario: Phase 1B — Logger writes to disk

**Preconditions:** App built and not currently running. `~/.tokenless/logs/` may or may not exist.

**Steps:**
1. Run `npm run preview` to launch the built app.
2. Wait for the window to open, then close it.
3. Inspect `~/.tokenless/logs/`.

**Expected:**
- A file `tokenless-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` exists (today's date).
- It contains at least 3 JSONL records: `logger-online`, `app-ready`, `shutdown` (from main) plus `mount` (from renderer via IPC).
- Each line parses as JSON with id, ts, severity, category, event, message, fingerprint, source fields.

## Scenario: Phase 1B — Dev Mode panel displays records

**Preconditions:** App built and running (`npm run preview`).

**Steps:**
1. Click "Show Dev Mode" in the top-right.
2. Observe the bottom drawer.
3. Click any severity chip (e.g., "warn") to filter.
4. Type into the search box (e.g., "mount").
5. Click any visible row to expand.
6. Reload the window (Ctrl+R).

**Expected:**
- Panel slides up from the bottom; shows a sortable table of log records.
- Severity filter narrows the visible rows.
- Search filter further narrows by event/message substring.
- Clicking a row reveals pretty-printed JSON below it; "Copy as JSONL" copies a single-line JSON string to clipboard.
- After reload, the Dev Mode panel is still open (localStorage persistence).
